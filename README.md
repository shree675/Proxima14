# Proxima14

## About
A recreation of the **Android 14 easter egg** game for desktop using pygame.

This is a mini space exploration game, set in the star system governed by Proxima Centauri, with a quick and tiny spacecraft accompanying you in your journey.  
Complete the exploration by landing on all the planets of the solar system.

This game features gravity, orbital motion and collision of objects.

## Controls
* Use <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> to steer your spacecraft.
* Hold <kbd>Space</kbd> to accelerate your spacecraft in the pointing direction.

## Contributing
### Known Bugs and Improvements
1. Attempting to land on a planet arriving from its opposite direction is making the spacecraft occassionally clip through the object. Collision physics needs to be improved.
2. Travelling too fast is causing the game to slightly stutter. Game performance needs to be improved.
3. Code refactoring is needed.
